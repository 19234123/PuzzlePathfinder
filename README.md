Puzzle-solving framework designed to solve state-based puzzles e.g. Farmer river crossing problem


State Generator Interface:
Define and generate states and valid moves


Puzzle Solver Class:
A graph-based puzzle solver using Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path to end state.
Uses graph implemented here: https://github.com/19234123/Graph_Pathfinding

Farmer Puzzle Class:
Example state class based on farmer river crossing problem
